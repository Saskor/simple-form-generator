Functions that have more than two arguments must destruct arguments values from the object
Examples:

More than two arguments
({arg1, arg2, arg3}) => {...}

Two or fever arguments
(arg1, arg2) => {...}


Difference between view and component

View render only one HTML tag (input, button, ets.)
View has no inner state.
